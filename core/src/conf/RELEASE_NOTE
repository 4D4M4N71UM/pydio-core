[Upgrade Process]

- Archive installations (zip/tar.gz)
First switch the "Update Engine" channel (in the plugin options) to the "Development" channel.
From 5.3.2 (dev) : automatic with in-app upgrade, only files are impacted.
From 5.2.3 (stable) : automatic with in-app upgrade. HOWEVER, make sure to backup both your DB and your files.

- Linux packages (deb/rpm)
Package is available in the testing channel for both repositories.
Database migration is not performed automatically, please use this script to manually upgrade your DB.
REMARK ABOUT SHARING: Old share links will be still active, but user will have to migrate them manually. As the new ones allow to manually set the final hash of the link, users will have to stop public links, recreate them, and change the hash.

[Known Issues]

The new theme is not yet fully optimized for mobile devices, and not at all supported by IE8 and earlier
User dashboard sometimes need some manual resizing to have all panel appear.
>> See github repository to see the list of existing issues and help us resolve them!
Rewrite rules in Htaccess files are to be "translated" for other webservers (nginx, IIS). Again, contribs welcome!
